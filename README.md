# CHD-TOF-Network-Diffusion-Model

This project uses publicly available genomic data to build a machine learning model that identifies genes most likely associated with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).

  *TOF is a congenital heart defect characterized by four structural abnormalities of the heart.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how artificial intelligence can be applied to public biological datasets to prioritize candidate genes involved in congenital heart disease.

This is a computational research project and does not involve clinical or patient data.
